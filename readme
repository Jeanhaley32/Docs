## Green Doc
A green doc is a preliminary design document that is used to gather feedback and input from stakeholders before the final design document is created. The green doc is typically less formal than the final design document and may not include all of the details that will be included in the final document. The purpose of the green doc is to get everyone on the same page about the project and to identify any potential problems or issues that need to be addressed before the final design is created.

Here are some of the benefits of using a green doc:

It can help to save time and money by identifying potential problems early on.
It can help to improve communication and collaboration between stakeholders.
It can help to ensure that the final design is well-thought-out and meets the needs of all stakeholders.
If you are working on a project that requires a design document, I recommend using a green doc to help you get started. It is a great way to gather feedback and input from stakeholders, identify potential problems, and improve communication and collaboration.

Here are some tips for writing a green doc:

Keep it short and to the point. The green doc is not meant to be a comprehensive document. It is simply a way to get everyone on the same page about the project.
Be clear and concise. The green doc should be easy to understand by everyone who will be reading it.
Use visuals. Visuals can help to communicate your ideas more effectively.
Get feedback. Once you have written a green doc, share it with stakeholders and get their feedback. This will help you to improve your document and make sure that it meets the needs of everyone involved.

## Blue Doc
A bluedoc is a more detailed version of a greendoc. It is used to communicate the final design of a project to stakeholders and to get their approval. The bluedoc is typically more formal than the greendoc and may include more technical details. The purpose of the bluedoc is to ensure that everyone involved in the project is on the same page about the final design and that there are no surprises when the project is implemented.

Here are some of the benefits of using a bluedoc:

It can help to save time and money by identifying potential problems early on.

## Post Mortem

 a postmortem is a document that is created after an incident or event in order to learn from it and improve the system. Postmortems are typically written by the team that was responsible for the incident, but they can also be written by other teams or individuals who have relevant expertise.

The goal of a postmortem is to answer the following questions:

What happened?
Why did it happen?
What could have been done to prevent it?
What will be done to prevent it from happening again?
Postmortems are an important part of continuous improvement. By learning from our mistakes, we can make our systems more reliable and our products better.

Here are some tips for writing a postmortem:

Be clear and concise. The postmortem should be easy to understand by everyone who will be reading it.
Be objective. The postmortem should focus on the facts, not on assigning blame.
Be constructive. The postmortem should focus on identifying root causes and solutions, not on rehashing the past.
Be timely. The postmortem should be written as soon as possible after the incident, while the details are still fresh.
Postmortems can be a valuable tool for learning and improving. By following these tips, you can write a postmortem that will help your team make your systems more reliable and your products better.
